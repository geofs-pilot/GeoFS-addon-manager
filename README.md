# GeoFS-addon-manager
Inspired by https://github.com/tylerbmusic/GeoFS-Addon-Menu

This creates an Addons item in the options panel, which drops down to allow you to run different addons. There is also a description section where you can put instructions, etc.

The userscript is an example setup that creates the addons above. You can add your own addons in the places that I've labeled accordingly.
I've included the version that I use. It includes 17 addons:
