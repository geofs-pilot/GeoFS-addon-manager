# GeoFS-addon-manager
Inspired by https://github.com/tylerbmusic/GeoFS-Addon-Menu

This creates an Addons item in the options panel, which drops down to allow you to run different addons. There is also a description section where you can put instructions, etc.

The userscript is an example setup that creates the addons above. You can add your own addons in the places that I've labeled accordingly.
I've also included the version that I use. It includes 16 addons (some of which I modified slightly to allow it to better run alongside the others*):

*modifications include CSS changes to make all the ui bar elements coexist neatly, integrating the fuel leak failure with the fuel addon (WIP), allowing slew mode, streetlights, and taxiway lights to all run at the same time (for some reason you could only run one at a time) (WIP), and remapping the FPV toggle key to [Insert] to prevent overlapping with the slew mode keybinds
